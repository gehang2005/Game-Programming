# Escape Classroom — What Did I Miss?

**What Did I Miss?** is an observation-based puzzle game inspired by *The Exit 8* and similar "endless classroom" experiences. Walk through a repeating classroom and corridor, spot anything out of place, and leave through the correct door. Clear 5 classes in a row to win.

---

## Overview

At the start of each class, the scene may contain **zero or one** anomaly. Your goal is not combat or traditional puzzles — it is to **memorize what the classroom normally looks like** and make the right call when something feels off:

- **Anomaly detected** → Leave through the **back door**
- **No anomaly** → Leave through the **front door**

A wrong choice resets your progress back to Class 1. After completing all 5 classes, head to the bed at the end of the corridor to trigger the ending.

## How to Run

### Requirements

- [Unity 2022.3.62f3c1](https://unity.com/) (or a compatible 2022.3 LTS release)
- Windows (current development platform)

### Play in the Editor

1. Open this project folder in Unity Hub (the directory containing `Escape Classroom.sln`)
2. Open `Assets/Scenes/MainMenu.unity`
3. Press **Play** and select **Class Begins !** from the main menu

Build scene order (`File → Build Settings`):

1. `Assets/Scenes/MainMenu.unity`
2. `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity`

---

## Gameplay Flow

```
Main Menu → Enter classroom scene
    ↓
Round starts: random anomaly spawns (or none)
    ↓
Player observes the classroom and corridor
    ↓
Exit through the front or back door
    ↓
  ├─ Correct choice → advance to the next class
  ├─ Wrong choice   → progress resets to Class 1
  └─ All 5 classes cleared → reach the bed → ending screen
```

### Decision Rules

| Round state | Correct exit |
|-------------|--------------|
| Anomaly present | Back door |
| No anomaly | Front door |

Current progress is shown in the UI (`Class 1` through `Class 5`).

---

## Anomalies

All anomaly objects live under the `Anomalies` scene node and are auto-collected by `ClassroomAnomalyRandomizer`. The current build includes:

| Name | Effect type | What changes |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Chihaya** | Texture swap | Quad image switches to an anomaly version |
| **nailongLaugh** | Proximity trigger | Texture changes and laughter plays when the player walks nearby |
| **frame** | Material swap | Painting inside the frame uses an anomaly material |
| **catmeme** | Texture swap | Multiple cat meme textures become anomalous |
| **cxk** | Model swap | Normal model is replaced with an anomaly model |

Each round has roughly a **90%** chance of spawning an anomaly and a **10%** chance of a completely normal classroom. The system also tries to avoid repeating the same anomaly on consecutive rounds.

### Core Scripts

| Script | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| `ClassroomGameFlowController` | Class progress, exit validation, win logic |
| `ClassroomAnomalyRandomizer` | Anomaly pool collection and per-round randomization |
| `TeleportTrigger` | Front/back door teleportation, triggers validation and new rounds |
| `IAnomalyEffect` | Shared anomaly interface (`Activate` / `Deactivate`) |
| `QuadTextureAnomaly` | Texture-based anomalies (Chihaya, catmeme) |
| `MaterialSwapAnomaly` | Material-based anomalies (frame) |
| `ModelSwapAnomaly` | Model-swap anomalies (cxk) |
| `ProximityTextureAnomaly` | Proximity-triggered texture + audio anomaly (nailongLaugh) |
| `SimplePlayerMove` | Third-person character movement with footstep audio |
| `CameraFollow` | Third-person follow camera with mouse look and scroll zoom |
| `DoorController` | Interactive door open/close with `F` key |
| `MainMenuController` | Main menu scene management |
| `MenuButtonHover` | Button hover animation effects |
| `GameEndTrigger` | Bed trigger after clearing all classes |
| `GameClearScreen` | Ending UI fade-in and buttons |
| `LaughTriggerForwarder` | Forwards proximity trigger events for laugh anomaly |

---

## Adding New Anomalies

1. Add a new child under the `Anomalies` node in `SampleScene` (preferably as a **direct child**)
2. Attach a script that implements `IAnomalyEffect`, or rely on simple `SetActive` visibility
3. Make sure **Auto Collect On Awake** is enabled on `ClassroomAnomalyRandomizer` (`AnomalyManager`)

You do not need to manually edit the `anomalies` list — placing objects under `Anomalies` adds them to the random pool automatically.
